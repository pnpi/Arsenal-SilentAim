**Information**

All information has been documented if you'd like to create your own, this is a very simple project, straight-forward even, check out "Internal.txt" for a brief log, "Internal.lua" is the loader file, load it and shoot, it's that simple, your bullets will curve to the target's nearest part to your cursor. That's about it. This project won't be getting updated, simply because there's nothing more to add, if you know a way to bypass the ban, then submit a pull request.
